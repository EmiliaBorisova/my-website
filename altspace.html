            <h3 class="h3-resume">Overview</h3>
            <p>
                During the first week of my internship at Avanade, my intern cohort was given an “Innovation Challenge” to be tackled 
                in teams of 5. The premise of this task was to create <i class="italic">something</i> that would improve morale and impact company culture in 
                a positive way. Being new to the company, my team and I interviewed employees to get an understanding of challenges in 
                the workplace. We also did online research, looking into both popular sources and academic sources. Through this 
                information-gathering process, we found that there is a difference between recognition and appreciation. Recognition is 
                performance-based, which includes bonuses, promotions, raises, and other monetary rewards. Appreciation, on the other 
                hand, is about acknowledging a person’s inherent value. The point isn’t their accomplishments. It’s their worth as a 
                colleague and a human being. 
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3-resume">The Product</h3>
            <p>
                Seeing correlations between this important distinction and our interview results, we developed a proposition that would 
                promote greater appreciation within the company. The idea is for people to send notes of appreciation to each other, 
                accompanied by a virtual reality item through AltspaceVR – Microsoft’s social VR platform. The items sent will mostly be 
                plants, flowers, animals, and other garden-themed decorations. This will be a team-based space incooporated into Microsfot Teams, where employees grow a 
                “Garden of Appreciation” together and bond using their avatars. As there are various ways of showing care for others, 
                there will also be the option of attaching a physical version of the virtual item as a gift which the company would fund and deliver to the recipient.

            <h3 class="h3-resume">Intrapreneurship Journey</h3>
            <p>
                After we presented our idea to the rest of the interns on the final day of the challenge, our team was selected to
                demonstrate the prototype to an HR representative and then a regional executive, both of whom adored the idea and 
                offered us extended internships to continue the development of this product throughout the year. We’ve received 
                mentorship and guidance from multiple VR experts and business leaders within the company since, which has helped 
                us refine our product idea to best service Avanade’s ideals and culture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once we decided on using the Agile methodology for our project, we developed a feature list for our minimum viable
                product, a workback schedule, a vision document, a Proof of Concept, a backlog in Azure DevOps, and a 30-60-90-day 
                business plan to bring to the executives funding our project. We have additionally performed duties three company 
                levels above our own, creating a financial plan and recruiting offshore software developers, architects, and a product 
                owner onto our team. Currently, the project is underway and scheduled to be complete in December 2021.
